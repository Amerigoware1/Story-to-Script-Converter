# Story-to-Script-Converter
The Story to Script Converter is a VB.NET application designed to simplify the process of creating audio versions of written stories using Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology. Unlike standard TTS readers, this program allows users to convert their stories into a script format where each line of dialogue and narration is tagged with the corresponding character or narrator. This enables TTS engines to use different voices for each speaker, creating a more engaging and immersive listening experience.
