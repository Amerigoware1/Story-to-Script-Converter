# Story-to-Script-Converter
The Story to Script Converter is a VB.NET application designed to simplify the process of creating audio versions of written stories using Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology. Unlike standard TTS readers, this program allows users to convert their stories into a script format where each line of dialogue and narration is tagged with the corresponding character or narrator. This enables TTS engines to use different voices for each speaker, creating a more engaging and immersive listening experience.

Download and run the Story to Script Converter application.
Use the "Browse" button on the first step to load your story file.
Click "Next" to proceed through the wizard.
Identify and select character names in the second step.
Assign dialogue lines to the identified characters in the third step.
Choose the desired TTS voice for each character and the narrator in the fourth step.
Review and save(.stc) the tagged script in the final step.
